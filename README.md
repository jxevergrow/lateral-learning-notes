# 🧠 Lateral Learning Notes: Python × JavaScript/TypeScript × C#

Welcome to my **Lateral Learning Notes** — a focused, cross-language journey to deepen my understanding of programming fundamentals by comparing how similar concepts are implemented and behave in **Python**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, and **C#**.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository serves three goals:

- 🎯 **Job-Readiness:** Show my technical depth and curiosity as I transition into development roles.
- 🔍 **Deeper Understanding:** Sharpen intuition by comparing language features and runtime behavior.
- 🧩 **Practical Reference:** Create a growing collection of bite-sized insights and code examples I (and others) can revisit anytime.

## 🧱 Structure

Each `.md` file in this repo contains:

- ✅ A concise **topic overview**
- 💡 Key **language comparisons**
- 🔢 Real code **examples**
- 🧠 Insightful **tradeoff** and **takeaways**
- 📌 When relevant, notes on **performance**, **memory**, and **runtime behavior**

## 💬 Why “Lateral Learning”?

I coined this term for my learning style:  
> “Instead of staying in one language silo, I move laterally across languages to **contrast, compare, and clarify** ideas I thought I already knew.”
